"Soft" measures such as pain are a better predictor of post patient satisfaction than "hard" indicators like tug delta.

"Soft" measures like pain are almost as good at predicting things like tug_delta as things like pre_ox, post_tug, and age are.

Doctors who think their patients are nice tend to think they will recover better (pre_d_sat and s_nice).

Doctors think that more anxious patients are less nice.  (s_nice and pre_anx_state/pre_anx_trait).

Doctor niceness (d_nice) and surgeon niceness (s_nice) not very closely correlated (.38)

Doctors think that nicer patients will be more satisfied (d_nice, pre_d_sat). (.63)  Correlation is .43 for physiologists (phys_nice and pre_phys_nice), and .812 for nurses (pre_n_dat, n_nice).  Niceness measurements of doctor, nurse, and physiologist only weakly correlated. (.25 for doctor/nurse, .09 for phys/nurse, .08 for doctor/phys).

Nurses much better than doctors at predicting patient satisfaction before the surgery (pre_d_sat/post_p_sat -> .03, pre_n_sat/post_p_sat -> .15), and much better than patients (pre_p_sat/post_p_sat -> .02).

Patient self-assessment of post health (post_p_health) not correlated to their satisfaction (post_p_sat).  But post_p_health correlated to tug_delta and post_ox.

post_p_sat correlated with post_anx_state and post_anx_state (-.3 and -.29).

How nice the doctor thinks the patient is (s_nice and d_nice) correlate somewhat with how satisfied the surgeon is with the surgery (post_s_sat) (.13 and .1).

Doctors think depressed patients will do worse (sumbdi_admin, pre_d_sat), but this is not actually the case (post_p_sat) (-.32 vs -.14).

More depressed patients have a higher tug (.34 correlation between sumbdi_admin and pre_tug).
